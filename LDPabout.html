      <p>My name is Leif Derrickson.  I am a creator.  I see big picture ideas and look for synergy in ordered chaos.  I enjoy dabbling in multiple hobbies because I believe that every skillset can offer new perspectives that I can utilize. I currently work as an Audio Mastering Engineer and Voice producer at National Audio Company in Springfield, MO.  There I have learned a lot about audio production for analog cassette tape and have had the opportunity to work on a few big name commercial projects from labels like Sub-Pop, Sony, and Universal.  I have recently been involved with a web development group called “Tarrick”, as a graphic artist and front-end developer. It is my dream to use my talents not only to produce beautiful, meaningful content for the world, but to also lead and inspire others to engage proactively in their endeavors.</p>
